# Call Trend Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of call trends, customer interactions, and regional operational performance, derived from the "Call Trend Analysis.PDF" document. The analysis provides deep insights into call data across three key geographical regions: **Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus**, and evaluates the performance of five distinct operational regions (**R01, R02, R03, R04, R05**).

## Interactive Filtering by Operational Region (R01-R05)

The analysis is designed to be interactive. If there are "buttons" or filters for **R01-R05**, clicking on them would dynamically change the displayed data to show metrics specific to the selected operational region. This functionality allows for a granular understanding of each region's performance.

Specifically, selecting an R0x region would update the following:

*   **Customer-Specific Call Amounts:** The amounts for each customer code (e.g., C0003, C0004) would filter to show only the revenue generated specifically through the selected R0x. For example, selecting **R01** would show that **C0003 generated $891** through R01, **C0004 generated $1,991** through R01, and so forth for all customers across Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus.
*   **Total Amount:** The overall amount displayed would update to reflect the **total revenue specific to the selected R0x** (e.g., $18.4k for R01, $20.6k for R02).
*   **Total Calls:** The total number of calls would update to show the **call count specific to the selected R0x** (e.g., 189 calls for R01, 218 calls for R02).

This interactive feature allows users to **drill down into the individual contributions and performance characteristics of each regional operation**.
